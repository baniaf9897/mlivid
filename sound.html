Fucking beautiful nature they got there, gorgeous rock faces (cover) and the craziest colourful plants. When the trail I took ended I just undressed and swam further up in the Yumuri river. The water was drinkable. Imagine swimming in the middle of deserted nature and rainforest and just sipping right from where you swim in.

                                            I dunno man, this place was sick, I hope you liked what was created out of the canyons inspiration.</h3>

                                        <h3>My musical tribute to one of the most beautiful places I got to experience.<h3>

                                        <h3>ViÃ±ales, a village in the northern end of the island Cuba. An area full of fascinating rocks stomping out of the ground and tobacco fields between those. Unfortunately it's full of tourists but as a tourists who am I to complain.</h3>
                                            
                                        <h3>The song in its emotional variety represents the feelings I had in ViÃ±ales over the days. Once you are confronted with dancing and cheering people in the village. But around the village you find the beauty in the silence. You stand there in front of these rocks. They are not even that high. But because of their shape and colour you are kind of positively awed by this sheer power of nature that put these into beeing. Kinda the feelings I tried to recreate in the outro.</h3>
                                            
                                        <h3>So many sounds in this track are directly taken from my recordings of this place. Be it the sounds of the birds that I never have had heard before, the soothing screaming of the 50 year old old-timer engines reverbing between the rocks, the sounds of a carriage I was able to hitchhike with which is layered under the hi-hats for more organic percussion sounds.</h3>
                                        <h3>The vocals to be honest were recorded a week later in the center of Havanna.</h3>
                                        <h3>-- [These slums are especially special in Havanna because the way people live there is different to the way people live in the whole rest of the island. Basically folks from the villages who had dreams of the big money and came to the big town to pursue their happiness and their kids. Their kids eventually grew up, never experiencing the world outside Havanna and end up being Hustlers. Same procedure as anywhere else but here it was even more shocking since the cubans in other parts of the island often appreciated what they had and at least a little happy up to fucking content! Anyways, as people in these slums often do when the materialistic goals made up by society seem too far away to be reached and other thought construct to give ones live sense fail, they face towards alcohol... or religion! And that's what I saw.] --</h3>
                                        <h3>I roamed through the blocks ad suddenly heard percussive tribal drumming and chanting in the distant. I followed the source of the sound. Turning around a corner I saw two dozens of people standing in front of a shop where music came out of. I went closer to see what was going on in the shop: 1 guy doing some seriously rhythmically disturbing things to a conga (by using big gaps between the beats he created a crazy feeling of rhythm with which one always anticipated the next beats), 2 guys with african shakers, 1 guy using a rusty propeller of a ship as a cowbell, 1 guy screaming the devil out of his lungs in some african language and 50 people on way to few sqare-meters dancing wildly with closed eyes and echoing whatever that crazy singer just screamed. I asked one other man who was not so blown away in another state of conciousness as the people inside clearly were what the heck es pasa aqui? He answered something about "ritual religioso" and "Africa".</h3>
                                        <h3>As the basic rhythm was constant for many minutes put my bag down, started the recording and tried to get into the tune they play. Always when I am on a techno party I have to force myself to dance and then after 5-10min I am in a state of trance. Here It was the same. I digged this conga beat for 20 minutes until I realised that it'd be a good time to turn off the recording to save memory for something else to come. Man, I was so fucking into it, waking up from this trance I felt connected to primal musical instincts that I had not felt in this manner before. I mean look at it, that's how it started back then in good old Africa: some drumming sounds and chanting. If you ever get to witness this African music and it doesn't catch you on the very first tone, give it a shot for a couple of minutes since it might really grab you!</h3>

                                        <h3>Last September I started to study Acoustical Engineering in Mittweida. It did not take long to find other Drum & Bass enthusiasts among my classmates. Matze (Matec) presented his humility to the genre obviously by wearing a Methlab pullover. After finding out that studying does not fill ones entire schedule in Mittweida I started to put some synthesizerlove on one of Matzes beats and the product is presented to you above.

                                        <h3>but what the fuck is "Sicherheit"?</h3>
                                            
                                        <h3>Back then we were a little bit affected by the election for the german parliament. Right-wing forces have grown stronger and the overall opinion of the middle shifts rightwards as well. To mirror our concerns about this development we inserted a vocal sample of Alice Weidel (hell of an straight-outta-economy populist shit talking cunt who got to sit in our parliament for the right-wing party since election.)</h3>
                                            
                                        <h3>Sicherheit means "safety". In the days of the election it was probably the populists' favourite word. By asking for more Sicherheit all the time and media constantly talking about nothing but the "unbearable" amount of refugees coming here the average Hans in Germany feels more and more unsafe, which critically effected the election result.</h3>
                                            
                                        <h3>So we added "Mit Sicherheit stirbt Freiheit" -> "Safety kills Freedom" to remind people of the freedom they give up by accepting all the the steps government takes or by letting in all the fears media wants to funnel into your mind without resistance.</h3>
                                        <h3>To put it in easier words -> fuck the system!</h3>
